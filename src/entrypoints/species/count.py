description = """
**Species counts (taxonomic registry only — no location/time filters).**

- **Route to this when**: The user wants counts of taxonomic entities (e.g., species/genera/families) based on taxonomy or status, independent of where/when they were observed. Examples include “how many species in Plantae?”, “number of endangered bird species worldwide,” “breakdown by rank.”
- **Do NOT use when**: The prompt includes any location, date/time, geospatial constraint, or mentions occurrences/records/observations/collected/specimens. Those must go to occurrence-based counting.

**Use Case:** Count GBIF name usages (taxonomic entities), not observations. Returns aggregated counts and facets over the taxonomic backbone.

**Triggers On (strong):** “how many species/genera/families,” “unique taxa (globally),” “by rank,” “by status,” “taxonomic breakdown,” “distinct taxa (no place/time).”
**Avoid If Present:** “in/within/near [place],” country/geometry/GADM, year/date/temporal filters, “records/occurrences/observed/collected/specimens.”

**Examples (choose THIS):**
- “How many genera are in Plantae?”
- “Number of endangered bird species worldwide.”
- “Breakdown of species by rank within Mammalia.”

**Examples (**MUST** choose the OTHER entrypoint):**
- “How many unique plant species in Gainesville?”
- “Distinct species recorded in Kenya in 2020.”
- “Top species by records near Paris.”

Limitations: Cannot filter by location, time, or record-level fields; does not guarantee presence/observation. It summarizes taxonomic entities only.
